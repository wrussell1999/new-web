  content: A hackathon is a creative and social 24-hour event where students come together in small teams to share ideas and build something new and exciting, alongside a whole bunch of like-minded people. You learn immensely with the help of mentors, interact with companies and have fun! Hackathons are very beginner friendly and open to students passionate about innovations, technology, engineering, entrepreneurship, design, or more!
